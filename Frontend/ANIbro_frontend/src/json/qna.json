        "answer": "Well the answer is that the API url I use also contains some adult content and genres which is not good for a kid so that is why I am asking the question, if you toggle the checkbox then you can also see the adult content else it will be normal content, now I know that some smart kid will still tick the adult button so if you ticked, then you cannot disable is rn but in future I maybe add the disable button as well maybe"
