Hey fellas 👋!
## Piyush's here!

this is one of my biggest project because it took me fully 1 week tbh
but I can say that-

**I have made a full-stack Anime/Manga recommendation website**

it uses *MERN stack* and *python*, in which:
- MERN - frontend and backend
    - React
    - Node js
    - MongoDB
- Python - Anime/Manga recommendation (using KNN)

***

### this whole website includes

- Email verification ✉️
- Anime/Manga Slides
- More Info about Anime/Manga
- Profile Pic changing
- User's Anime list
- User's Manga list
- User Profile 👤
- Anime/Manga toggler
- English/Japanese toggler
- Search Anime
- Search key results
- Genre Anime (like Action, Advanture Anime/Manga) 
- toaster messages 💬
- personal *bro* vibes 
- skeleton loading 🔃

**temp Incompletions:-**
- currently the recommender part doesn't work but I will gonna fix it shortely
- and it is also not responsive so for now, please open my website in your laptop or pc.

It literally took me 1 month+ 💀.

well I have finally completed the v1 of ANIbro 
you can go to this link and get recommended anime:- <br/>
[ANIbro](https://anibro-five.vercel.app/)

I was also learning node js and python models using sklearn and implemented in this website

everything in my website is functionable and ready to work

I have also got so many errors which took me hours or days to debugs but I still debugged it and it is ready to go

also, I took help of some AI including chatGPT and all but all the imagining and code work and understanding is done by me

tbh I have learned a lot with this project and made during my sem break.

## Story time:-

During my sem, I was watching *One Piece* (and it is peak!). well at the end of the one piece, I was seaching for new anime and got thousands of anime.

now, in order to store my anime, I need an anime website who can manage website for me.

now yes their are countless website like *myAnimeList* and more but some has UI issue and some has SOO MUCH ADS!!

so I have then decided to make my own Anime list website and add the recommendation part

now I also decided that, my website should be personalized AF so that the user won't gonna say, "nah man this is not the website" or something and also I needed to know how recommender works and also how the backend and frontend communicate together 

now because I wanted to use my skills which I have recently aquired like node js and sklearn I started to create my website *ANIbro*.

I made the theme **black-gold** so that it looks premium.

and another reason behind ANIbro is that because I wanted to make website more personal that's why I wanted to give it a *bro vibe⭐*.

and now I have also made the login and signup system too.

***

I have also used API-URL of *jiken* so I will give credit to that website too!

you can also tell me if you like my website.

I will be making more projects like this!

see ya!
